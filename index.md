# Welcome to the Dirkles68 Learning Blog

I plan on learning a lot of new things . Some of these include, but are not limited to:

- ArcGIS
- QGIS
- Python
- SQL
- Git/GutHub
- LINUX terminal

I will use this page to track what I am learning and provide some examples of my acomplishments. 

_"Isn't this **too much** to learn?"_ you might be asking. Well, you are probably right. But what the heck, I should give it a try. 

Thanks for visiting. I hope to see you again soon
