Hello, and welcome to day 1 of my learning blog. Here I will begin my journey of learning something new. I plan on expaning my skills into some programming languages and sharpening my now dull GIS skills. I would like to become proficient in Python, Sand SQL to start off with. Along the way, I will be doing some GIS projects to increase my skillset and refresh some things that I have forgotten. 

Before I dive deep into programming though, I will begin with some basics in many of the things that are heavily involved with all things programming. LINUX bash/terminal, GitHub, Dropbox to name a few. All of these things I need to do well to help with everything else I plan on doing. 

Wish me luck!
