### DAY TWO

__How hard could this be?__

So here I am, at two days of using GitHub. I don't really know what for yet, but I can see something brewing in the distance. I have plans (maybe), or a vision, I just can't quite grasp what it is entirely. What I would like to do is set up this blog, or maybe a website of my own that contains all of my learning accomplsihments. From learning GitHub, Python, SQL, QGIS, ArcMap, etc. The more I do this, the easier is should become, or at least I hope so. 

__How will I work this all out?__

I don't know yet. Maybe I should start an a spreadsheet for now, will al my learing resources listed out in a nice place. That might be a good start. I think I am going to start that right now, or at least right after I finish this post. Or maybe tomorrow. To quote my 5 year old son, "tomorrow is my favorite day to do that".

I have attempted this learning journey before, but the advantage I have now is an awareness of the pitfalls of self-learning. When you think it is ok to take a break for a couple days or a week, that is a sign that your interest or desire is beginning to waver, and you must find a new way to keep the spark alive. Until you are doing work/hobby/play daily with any of these new skills, it is too dangerous to take a break. It is too easy to let things slide, and once you do, it is difficult to step back on where you left off. I have this wisdom on my side, and a little more motivation I hope with keeping things organized. I like being organized, and sure, it might be overkill to list everything on a spreadsheet, but it just may be what I need to see this all to the finish. 

__So what is the actual plan?__

1. Set up a spreadsheet as a learning hub. 
2. Continue to blog __*everyday*__.

That is it for now. Adios.
